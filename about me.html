<h2>
  Reasons for joining alt school
</h2>
  </p>

<p>
  Sometime ago, i got so bothered about not having a job after searching and searching. i lost interest and wasn't 
  interested again, then i met a friend of mine who is already into tech, and suggested i try something else outside 
  the normal things. i did my research on how i can enroll for my self leearning, then fortunately for me i came 
  across someone's tweet on twitter about alt school and i immediately took interest and enrolled.<br>
  This is entirely a new phase in my life, because i have no regrets or whatsoever as to why i joined alt school.
  I really want people to take up challenge and give it a try, i want to introduce this system of knowledge to my
  immediate society. i want to gain practical knowledge, industry specific skills, to pursue a career in tech.
  I joined alt school because i believe they are innovative enough to help me gain this life changing experience,
  and they are well known for providing unique learning experiences not offered by traditional schools.
</p>
<h2>
  What i plan to achieve
</h2>
By joining alt school, i aim to cultivate a dynamic and flexible learnining environment, enhance my critical 
thinking skills, and work with great and skillful personnels in the field. I also hope to collaborate with a community
of motivated individuals.<br>
In the next two years i see myself expanding my knowledge. I'm excited to embrace innovative teaching methods and develop
a strong foundation for life-long learning.<br>
Thank you alt school for this great opportunity and i look forward to mentioning you as part of my success story. Cheers.
